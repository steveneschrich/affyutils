# affyutils
 An R package of Affymetrix array-based utility functions

This package is a collection of functions that make working with
Affymetrix arrays easier within Bioconductor. Some are simple functions to do
things that I can't always remember how to do, some are more involved but are
things I typically do with this type of data.

It remains in early-stage development and is geared toward lowering the friction of day-to-day 
analysis in R/Bioconductor.
